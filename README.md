# Learning Robot Skills with Temporal Variational Inference

This repository has code for our ICML 2020 paper on Learning Robot Skills with Temporal Variational Inference. 
In the paper (and this code), we jointly learn robot skills and how to use them, from demonstrations in an unsupervised manner.
